 ** Hello World!**
  
  
  
  In this blog I will document my journy through the world of coding. 
  
  
  The beginning of the journy is missing; I started about 2 months ago. I may yet get around to writing up that part of it as well.
  
  In the meantime, sit back and enjoy.
  
  
  P.S. It goes without saying that if anyone who happens to chance upon this blog has any feedback at all it will be extremely welcomed.
